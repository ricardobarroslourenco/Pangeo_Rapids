# Pangeo-Rapids
Creates a Pangeo-like environment from scratch using conda-like repos.

## Package selection 
The criteria for package selection is quite arbitrary, trying to shoot for remote-sensing usage, but the ones listed 
at the [xarray related projects list](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/ecosystem.html#xarray-related-projects).

# Install instructions
Donload the repository, and run it on a shell-like system, 
such as Linux or *nix with execution permission. 

For Windows users, 
just go over a regular Miniconda install, and then run on console the mamba setup, 
as well the main package step, listed on `setup.sh`.
